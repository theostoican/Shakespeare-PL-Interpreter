Romeo , someone .
Juliet , someone else .
Ophelia , another one .
Hamlet , they just keep coming .


	Act I : wild act appears .
	Scene I : wild scene comes next .
	
	Act II : a friendly act . 
	Scene I : I hate scenes !!! .
[ Enter Romeo and Hamlet ]
Hamlet:
	You stupid damned rotten vile half-witted coward !
[ Exeunt ]
	
	Act III : the death of act 1 and 2 .
	Scene I : last scene .
[ Enter Hamlet and Ophelia ]

Hamlet:
 You lying stupid fatherless big smelly half-witted coward ! You are as stupid as the
 difference between a handsome rich brave hero and thyself !
 

 Speak your mind !
 Open your heart !

[ Exit Hamlet ]
